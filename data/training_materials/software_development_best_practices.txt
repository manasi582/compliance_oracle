Software Development Best Practices

This guide defines our engineering standards and ensures consistency across teams.

1. Version Control  
   - Use Git with feature-branch workflows.  
   - All pull requests require at least one peer review.

2. Code Quality & Testing  
   - Write clean, modular, and reusable code.  
   - Maintain at least 80% unit test coverage.

3. Secure Coding  
   - Follow OWASP Top 10 security guidelines.  
   - Never hardcode API keys, tokens, or credentials.  
   - Validate all user input to prevent injection attacks.

4. Documentation  
   - Update README files for every new module.  
   - Include code comments for complex logic sections.

5. DevOps & Deployment  
   - Use CI/CD pipelines for all builds.  
   - Monitor logs post-deployment for anomalies.

6. Collaboration  
   - Communicate code changes in team stand-ups.  
   - Respect code ownership boundaries and review etiquette.
